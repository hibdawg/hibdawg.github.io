An Orange County native, Hibah is a fourth-year Environmental Studies and Geography major with an emphasis in GIScience. Her interests are focused on conservation, soil, and spatial science. Passionate about real-world applications, Hibah has experience in research, the nonprofit sector, and fieldwork. This past summer she worked as an Island Biosecurity Intern for the Nature Conservancy where she experimented with biosecurity technology to strengthen the Channel Islands resilience plan against invasive species. With a graduate student mentor, she observed animal interaction, collected data, and synthesized a final research report. She also has previous work experience as a Light pollution Analysis intern where she worked with Lisa Stratton and fellow interns, strengthening her focus on conservation. Hibah looks forward to growing her technical skills and pursuing a career in conservation after graduation. In her free time, Hibah enjoys taking sunset walks, rock-climbing at the Rec Cen and watching movies.
