An Orange County native, Hibah is a fourth-year Environmental Studies and Geography double major with an emphasis in GIScience. Her interests are focused on conservation, soil, and spatial science. This past summer she worked as an Island Biosecurity Intern for the Nature Conservancy where she experimented with biosecurity technology to strengthen the Channel Islands resilience plan against invasive species. She also has previous work experience as a Light pollution Analysis intern where she worked with Lisa Stratton and fellow interns, strengthening her focus on conservation. She is currently working as a field ecology intern at the Los Padres National Forest identifying plants before and after grazers! In her free time, Hibah enjoys taking sunset walks, rock-climbing at the Rec-Cen and watching movies.
